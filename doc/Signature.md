| February 16 | 1 hour     | Filled out most of the SDP Phase 0 and studied the FIPS code system.
| Febraury 17 | 1.5 hours  | Finished filling out SDP Phase 0 and found all columns in the main csv file

| February 19 | 1   hour   | Completed Phase 1 of SDP
| February 20 | 2   hours  | Worked on Phase 2, got stuck with checking if FIPS is int(.isdigit() and .isnumeric() didn't work) and values I had passed into variables didn't work either for their if statements
| February 21 | 2   hours  | Fixed checking if FIPS is int and checking variables in if statement, got everything to work so that the output is the same as output.txt (except for the "in 2021" on each header is different, which might not be meant to be there in output.txt)
| February 22 | 0.75 hours | Tested my code with 6 different modules and found no errors
| TOTAL       | 9.0 hours  |
